97950143,Akbari,2014,Effects of menthol essence and breast milk on the improvement of nipple fissures in breastfeeding women,"Akbari et al studied the effects of menthol essence and breast milk on the improvement of nipple fissures in breastfeeding women in a study conducted in Tehran, Iran. In this randomised controlled trial, n=110 primiparous women were randomly allocated to receive menthol essence, in the form of menthol drops (n==55) or expressed breastmilk (n=55) for treatment of nipple fissures caused by breastfeeding after every feeding, for a period of 12 days (starting at 3 days postpartum). Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) (over the 10 cm tape, numbers 1-3 = mild pain, 4-7 = moderate pain and 8-10 = severe pain), 3 days after delivery, 10 days after delivery and 14 days after delivery. Outcome was measured as change in pain intensity. Pain intensity measured 3 days after delivery, 10 days after delivery (7 days of treatment) 14 days post-delivery (11 days of treatment); 3 days after delivery, pre and post application of menthol vs breastmilk comparison yielded p = 0.34. On day 10 after delivery, both groups showed a statistically significant difference in pain (p<0.001, p=0.002, mean VAS for BM>M). On day 14 after delivery, both groups showed a statistically significant difference in pain (p<0.001, p=0.001, mean VAS for BM>M).",Unregistered,Parallel groups,Random,Pre-existing,Breastfeeding,Nipple damage from breastfeeding,EMR,Iran,110,Female,Menthol,"Menthol essence in form of menthol drops produced by Poursina Co., Iran",Solution,NI,"Nipple, areola",Active,Breast milk,Breast milk,NI,Intensity,VAS,3,VAS difference 14 days after delivery (4.32 - 1.32) - Table 2,Positive,Significant,No information,N/A,none

In a randomised controlled trial conducted in USA, funded by Johnson and Johnson and Biofreeze, n=20 (mean age = 47.6 years) women experiencing hand arthritis were recruited and randomly assigned to either receive massage + application of 4% menthol BIofreeze (n=10) or only massage (n=10) for a period of 1 month. Pain measures were taken before and after the first and last massage therapy session, using VITAS (a Visual Analog Scale ranging from 0 for no pain to 10 for worst possible pain anchored with 5 faces). Outcome was identified as decrease in perceived pain. The group that experienced massage + topical menthol experienced greater changes in expected direction from the first to the last day of treatment (t = 2.04, p < 0.05) than the massage group. Both groups experienced significant decrease (at different significance levels) in pain perception from the first day to the last day: massage + analgesic groups experienced change in VITAS from 4 to 2 ( p < 0.01) and massage group from 5 to 4 (p < 0.05).",Unregistered,Parallel groups,Random,Pre-existing,Arthritis,Hand arthritis pain,AMR,USA,20,Female,Menthol,Biofreeze,Gel,4,Wrist and hand,Inactive,No treatment,Massage alone,Massage,Intensity,VAS,2.04,t-statistic for pain change test - text,Positive,Significant,No information,N/A,none

In this randomised controlled, double-blinded trial conducted in Chile in 3 phases, n=31 participants with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 experiencing non-specific low back pain in the lumbar region without peripheral radiation were randomly assigned, in Phase 1, to three groups. Group 1 trained with elastic resistance twice a week prior to application of the menthol gel (RTM; n = 10). Group 2 trained with elastic resistance twice a week prior to application of a placebo gel (RTP; n = 10). Group 3 was the control group (CG; n = 11) and did not undergo training. Post Phase 1, there was detraining for all groups for 12 weeks. In Phase 2, at 32 weeks, participants were once more shuffled and n=20 were randomly allocated to either RTM or RTP. Roll on Biofreeze gel and a roll-on placebo gel minus menthol were applied to the lumbar region T12 to L5 during interventions. Pain was measured using the VAS at baseline, Week 12, and Week 32. Outcome was identified as reduction in lower back pain. In Phase 1, VAS for the RTM and RTP groups improved without differences between groups (VAS of both training groups were significantly lower post-training).The RTM group presented greater improvements compared to the RTP group with significant intragroup differences (p ≤ .01) and high effect size for the changes in pain.

97950226,Gillis,2020,Influence of Menthol on Recovery From Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage,"Gillis et al measured the influence of menthol on recovery from exercise induced muscle damage among a sample in Massachusetts, USA. In this randomised controlled study, n=47 male, healthy, volunteers were randomly allocated to three groups, menthol (M) (n = 15, 23.1 (3.8) years), placebo (P) (n = 14, mean 22.6 (3.0) years) and control (CON) (n = 18, mean 23.4  (3.2) years). Each group underwent muscle soreness induction protocol. On Day 1, 2 and 3 of familiarisation, they completed a warm up protocol of 5 laps around basketball court, sprinting-specific dynamic warm-up consisting of soldier walks (elbow/knee joints held in extension), butt kicks, high knees, walking on toes, cariocas, and side steps over with a squat, four 15-m sprints of increasing intensity. On Day 1 of testing a sprinting protocol (repeated sprinting: 40 15-m sprints with a 5-m deceleration zone) was used to induce soreness. On testing Days 2,3,4 and 5 warm-up protocol was completed before intervention application, followed by test battery. According to group, participants applied Biofreeze gel composed of 4% menthol with trace amounts of camphor, placebo gel with no menthol but containing trace amounts of camphor or nothing (CON). A PainTest FPN 100 Algometer was used to apply 30 N of force to each muscle belly of the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and gastrocnemius muscles on familiarization and testing days. Pain was then measured using a categorical pain scale and the gLMS (general Labelled Magnitude Scale) at baseline the week before the test, and the mean of three familiarisation days post test. Over the test days, pain scale data was collected immediately post-sprint and gLMS once daily at testing Days 2,3,4 and 5. Outcome was identified as muscle soreness; The data favours both M and P over CON (at baseline, 24 and 48 h), and for P over M (at 48h, not at any other timepoints), indicating a placebo effect.

In a randomised controlled trial conducted in Canada, n=16 physically active participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups: menthol (mean 24.2 +/- 2.1 years) or ice (22.8 +/- 1.8 years). All subjects underwent a DOMS induction protocol exercise. Each subject performed ten sets of 10 repetitions of this eccentric exercise of the non-dominant arm. A one-minute recovery period was provided between each set. DOMS was induced in the non-dominant elbow flexor and biceps brachii in this study as an experimental tool to induce musculotendinous pain. 48 hours post DOMS induction, either 3.5% menthol Biofreeze or crushed ice in a plastic bag were applied to the over the belly of the biceps brachii. Pain scale was measured at (T1) prior to inducement of DOMS, (T2) 20 minutes after menthol application, (T3) 25 minutes and (T4) 35 minutes following the application of the menthol gel using the soreness rating scale along with the 10-point, 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. Outcome was identified as perception of soreness. There were no significant differences between groups for any baseline (T1) measures. There was a significant (p=0.025; ES=1.2) difference in soreness perception with the VAS scale between the application of ice and the menthol based topical analgesic.

97950304,Keshavarzian,2017,Comparison of the Effect of Topical Application of Rosemary and Menthol for Musculoskeletal Pain in Hemodialysis Patients,"Keshavarzian et al compared the effects of topical application of rosemary oil vs menthol for relief of musculoskeletal pain in haemodialysis patients. In a randomised controlled, single-blinded study conducted at two hospitals in Iran, 105 (mean age 56.89 (8.86) years) patients with chronic kidney failure and undergoing three sessions of haemodialysis per week, experiencing musculoskeletal pain in the legs were randomly allocated to one of three groups: Control, (n = 35), Menthol (n = 35), Rosemary (n = 35). They were instructed to apply 5% menthol drop, rosemary oil spray or placebo ointment (Vaseline) three times a day at the site of pain in the legs for three consecutive days. Outcome was measured as pain relief, through the 10‐point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI‐NRS) before the intervention, and 4 hours after each medication use in the morning and noon. One‐way ANOVA results showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of pain intensity before the intervention (p = 0.83), but showed a significant difference between the groups after the intervention (p = 0.001). Paired t‐test showed that the mean pain intensity score of the rosemary and menthol groups were significantly lower after the intervention compared to before the intervention (p < 0.001). Mean variation in pain intensity in the placebo group was significantly lower than the rosemary (p < 0.001) and menthol groups (p = 0.005). However, no significant difference was observed between the menthol and rosemary groups in this regard (p = 0.115).

In a randomised controlled double blinded study conducted in 16 centres in Germany, n=385 participants were recruited and n=360 participants completed the study after being randomly allocated to one of four groups (Placebo (P) (n=76, analysed n= 75), mean age 33.2 (11.6), Menthol (M) (n=78, analysed n =74), mean age 33.8 (12.2), Menthol + Diclofenac (DM) (n=118, analysed n = 105), mean age 32.4 (11.8), Diclofenac (D) (n=112, analysed n = 106), mean age 32.1 (11.4)). A block randomization method was used to randomize the patients into the four treatment groups in a 3:3:2:2 ratio. The randomization was stratified by site and age group (Stratum 1: 16- to 17- year-old patients; Stratum 2: 18- to 65-year- old patients). Participants had experienced a unilateral grade I or II acute sprain for the lateral or medial ankle within 24 hours of presentation. The intervention involved application of one of four gels (based on group): 3% menthol (M),1% diclofenac + 3% menthol (DM), placebo with 0.09% menthol (P) or 1% diclofenac + 0.09% menthol (D) 4 times daily at 4-to 6-hour intervals either until complete resolution of pain and swelling or for 10 days, whichever occurred first. Paracetamol was dispensed for use as a rescue medication, though patients were encouraged to wait at least two hours after application of intervention medication (rescue medication was used on one or more occasions by 20 (17.1%) patients in the DM group, 17 (15.2%) in the 1% D group, 19 (24.7%) in the 3% M  group, and 18 (24.0%) in the P group). Both patients and key staff blinded to the treatment allocation; subtherapeutic amounts of menthol were added to all solutions for its fragrance to maintain investigator and patient blinding to the treatment assignments. On the day of treatment, Pain Intensity (PI) was recorded at baseline and then PI and Pain Relief (PR) were recorded at 10 and 30 minutes, at 1, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after the first dose, and then twice daily on days 2 through 10. PI was recorded at rest and on movement (walking 5 steps on a flat surface) using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) with scores of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain). The Pain Relief Score (PRS) was recorded using a 5-point categorical scale of 0 = no PR, 1= a little or perceptible PR, 2 = meaningful PR, 3 = a lot of PR, and 4 = complete PR; area under curve of PI on movement as measured on the NRS from 24 to 72 hours after the initial treatment application. Time to onset of PR (time point at which the patients first reported a PRS of >= 1), time to meaningful PR (first recording of a PRS of >= 2) and time to complete recovery (complete relief of ankle pain and swelling), as well as SPID sum of differential of PI (baseline - timepoint) and TOTPAR (sum of (PRSt X [timet - timet–1])) were calculated. PI on movement AUC from day 1 to day 3 involved no difference between DM and P or DM and D or DM and M. There was no significant difference between P and D or M or DM at 24, 48, 72h. Upon calculation of PID under rest, M was never different from P at 24, 48, 72h; nor were any of the other groups D, DM to placebo. PR Scores indicated no difference between DM and P or D or M at any timepoint from 10 minutes to 72 hours. Mean PR was similar across all four treatment groups, and the active controls did not significantly improve the PRS compared with placebo at any time point. Time to onset of PR, time to meaningful PR and time to complete recovery measures did not reveal any meaningful advantages for MD over P or M or D. SPID and TOTPAR were non-significant for M, D, DM against P at timepoints 1-3 and 0-7 days.

In this randomised controlled double-blinded study, the data collected from n=180 subjects who were randomised into two groups, peppermint (n=90) and expressed breast milk (n=90). Groups were stratified based on type of birth. Mothers were advised to apply cotton soaked with peppermint water or expressed breast milk (based on their group) to their nipples and areolas after each feed and wash off before the next feed. Telephone interviews were conducted by a trained midwife on days 4, 8 and 14 postpartum. Data regarding main outcome measures were taken down in a telephone interview at week 6. A questionnaire was used to determine the presence and severity of nipple damage and pain. Each mother scored her own pain during breastfeeding. Rating scales were used to determine the level of pain as follows: no pain, mild (discomforting), moderate (distressing), and severe (excruciating). The outcome was to determine the effectiveness of peppermint water on prevention of nipple cracks compared to application of expressed breast milk. In the first 2 weeks, women in the peppermint water group were less likely to report pain (n = 6) than women in the breast milk group (n = 26) (p < 0.001). The breast milk group had a higher odds of experiencing nipple pain than the breast milk group (OR 5.6, 95% CI: 2.2,14.6) (3) During the study, mothers who used peppermint water had a decreased odds of (3.2, 95% CI: 3.02,6.31) of having pain, while mothers using expressed breast milk had an odds of 0.53 of pain reduction (95% CI: 0.41,0.68).

A sitz bath was performed for about 15 minutes in a container filled with water heated to 30-40 °C at the 4th hour after the surgery, after the first defecation, and at the 18th hour. In the intervention group, menthol drops were added to the bath. Pain ratings were collected before the sitz bath, 15 minutes after, before enema and after defecation at the 9th-10th hour, using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) with 0 indicating no pain,1-3 indicating mild pain, 4-6 indicating moderate pain, and 7-10 indicating severe pain.

In a double blind, randomised controlled trial, supported by The Mentholatum Company Ltd, the data of 181 (mean age 36.18 years) participants (randomised into three groups: Ibuprofen-Levomenthol group (n= 59), Diclofenac (n = 61), Ibuprofen (n = 61)) was collected, based on an inclusion criteria that identified patients with acute soft-tissue injury and reported moderate pain (>=6/11 on NRS) at baseline. Injuries were most commonly on lower back (79/181) and back (45/181). Of interest in the study was identifying whether levomenthol improved efficacy when added to ibuprofen gel. In the intervention group, 3% w/w levomenthol + ibuprofen (5% w/w) gel was applied by a healthcare professional to the injured body location. In the control groups, 3% w/w purified water + ibuprofen (5% w/w) in Ibuprofen gel, and diclofenac 1.16% gel were applied in the same manner. Pain intensity was measured using the 11-point NRS at 17 time points post application, as well as global assessment of pain relief on a 7-point scale (‘no relief’ to ‘complete relief’), at 2 hours post application. Time to significant pain relief was also calculated. The results indicated that application of ibuprofen/levomenthol gel or diclofenac gel resulted in a shorter median time to significant pain relief (20 minutes) compared with application of the ibuprofen gel (25 minutes). Survival analysis (because some study participants did not experience significant pain relief at the end of the 2-hour assessment period) did not result in statistically significant differences among the three treatment groups at 30 minutes or 120 minutes. However, at the 30-minute time point, 71.2% of patients in the ibuprofen+levomenthol gel group reported a 2-point reduction in pain score compared with only 55.7% of patients in the ibuprofen gel group. The median score change (between baseline and two-hours timepoint) was –3 for the ibuprofen+levomenthol and diclofenac gels and –2 for the ibuprofen gel, but tests for differences among the three groups failed to reach the level of statistical significance (p = 0.070). A statistically significant difference was found in the median global pain values among the three groups (Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in median global pain relief between the ibuprofen+levomenthol gel and diclofenac gel groups, but treatment with either of these gels resulted in a superior outcome compared with treatment with ibuprofen gel.

97950175,Yaman,2021,The effects of Biofreeze and superficial heat on masticatory myofascial pain syndrome,"Yaman et al compared the effects of Biofreeze versus superficial heat on masticatory myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). In a randomised controlled trial conducted in Turkey, 52 (mean age 36.75±10.47 years) participants (7 male, 45 female) were randomly assigned to receive Biofreeze (n=26) or superficial hear treatment (n=26). Inclusion criteria required diagnosis of MPS, and no history of occlusal split usage. The presence of hard, palpable nodules in the masseter and temporalis muscles, indicating the active myofascial trigger points, was the common feature of all patients in this study. Pain severity data was collected as a comparison between unassisted mandibular opening without pain, and maximum assisted mandibular opening. The intervention involved use of Biofreeze 3.5% gel applied twice a day for 7 days, and compared to application of superficial moist heat with a towel soaked in hot water (212 degrees F) for the same period of time. Pain severity was measured at baseline, 7th, and 21st days; by bilateral manual palpation, pain in the masseter and temporal muscles were recorded using the Visual Analog Scale (0-10 scale), and the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) scores of patients, scored between 0-4. The outcome was measured as impact on myofascial pain; results for 2-way repeated measure ANOVA pre-and-post menthol intervention were: VAS (p = 0.221), OHIP-14 score (p=0.912), unassisted mandibular opening (p=0.875), maximum assisted mandibular opening (p=0.849). There were no statistically significant differences between Biofreeze and superficial heat group. There was a time effect in the four outcomes: p <0.001; <0.001; <0.001; <0.00 respectively. There was also a significant Time x Treatment interaction for OHIP-14 scores: p = 0.376; 0.018; 0.087; 0.054 respectively. Favourable effects of both treatments continued only during usage period; significant reduction in VAS and OHIP-14 scores was observed on 7th day compared to baseline (p<0.001), but increased significantly on 14th day compared to 7th day (p<0.001).",Unregistered,Parallel groups,Random,Pre-existing,Myofascial pain,Masticatory myofascial pain syndrome,EUR,Turkey,52,Mixed,Menthol,Biofreeze,Gel,3.5,Masseter and temporal muscles,Active,Heat,Heat,NI,Intensity,VAS,0.221,p-value for assessment of treatment effect (menthol vs heat) for VAS outcome - table 2; direction of effect determined from Table 3,Positive,Non-significant,No information,N/A,none
97950319,Andersen,2016,"High-Concentration L-Menthol Exhibits Counter-Irritancy to Neurogenic Inflammation, Thermal and Mechanical Hyperalgesia Caused by Trans-cinnamaldehyde","Andersen et al examined menthol’s counterirritancy effects to neurogenic Inflammation, thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia caused by trans-cinnamaldehyde. In a randomised controlled double-blinded crossover study conducted in Denmark, n=14 (mean: 23.2 +/- 0.92 years) participants with no pain conditions and free of neurological, dermatological, or musculoskeletal disorders received topical cinnamaldehyde (CA) (>= 99%) dissolved in 90% ethanol at concentrations of 10% (vol/vol) or 40% (wt/vol) L-menthol with 10% (vol/vol) CA dissolved in 90% ethanol at different timepoints, applied in randomised order to the volar aspect of the dominant or non-dominant forearm (randomised). Two cotton pads soaked in a solution of 40% (wt/vol) L-menthol with 10% (vol/vol) CA were placed in the laboratory 20 minutes before the onset of testing to create an overwhelming ambient smell of both applied substances, to inhibit the ability of the investigator and participants to identify the order of solutions investigated using olfaction. Heat pain was induced using CA. Application of CA was compared against application of a combination of CA and l-menthol. Randomisation of arms and order of solutions was conducted; one solution was applied, wiped off, and pain measures were taken, then the other was applied to the other arm, wiped off, and mechanical and thermal pain threshold was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) every minute during the 20 minutes of application (ranging from ‘‘no pain’’ = 0, to ‘‘worst imaginable pain’’ = 10), qualitative pain descriptors on the basis of the validated brief descriptive Danish version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire time points of 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, perceived area of pain, cold pain threshold (CPT) and heat pain threshold (HPT) using Medoc Pathway equipped with an advanced thermal stimulator probe, mechanical pain threshold (MPT) using VAS, area under curve, mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) with stimulation starting approximately 6 cm away from the application area and continued toward the application site until the volunteer reported an increase in sharp/pricking pain. Outcome was identified as modifications in pain thresholds and peak pain intensity. CA-evoked cutaneous pain was partially relieved by coapplication of L- menthol (P <= 0.01, paired Student t-test). If excluding the 3 subjects with peak pain intensity scores of <1, the peak pain intensity for the remaining group was 3.87 +/- 0.46 for the CA and 3.05 +/- 0.57 for the CA with L- menthol condition (P < 0.05). The spatial and temporal pattern of the pain was not significantly altered by concomitant administration of L-menthol. Positive correlation was observed between pain intensity after CA application and the size of the reported pain area (r = 0.592, P = 0.026); however, this association was not significant in the CA coapplied with L-menthol group. No statistics were provided for CPT and HPT on menthol + CA vs CA alone. There was no statistically significant difference in MPT between interventions with VAS at 0.5, but there was a significant difference (p<= 0.05) between interventions with CA+m showing an increase pinprick weight when VAS was 1 and 2. For all VAS, AUC of mechanical sensitivity was no different between interventions, but area of secondary hyperalgesia was decreased in CA+m compared to CA alone (p<0.01 paired Student t-test).

97950432,Borhani Haghighi,2010,"Cutaneous application of menthol 10% solution as an abortive treatment of migraine without aura: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossed-over study","Borhani Haghighi et al studied the effect of cutaneous application of menthol 10% solution as an abortive treatment of migraine without aura. In this randomised controlled, triple-blinded crossover study conducted in Shiraz, southern Iran, n=35 (mean age 29.65 ± 6.23 years) participants with a definite diagnosis of migraine headache, with a history of migraine longer than a year, experiencing 1-6 migraines per month were randomly allocated to one of two arms (Arm A n= 17, Arm B n= 18) (Intend-to-treat population = 35). Testing occurred over a period of 4 migraines. In Arm A, the initial two migraine attacks were treated with 1ml of 10% solution of menthol crystals in ethanol (M) and the second two attacks with 0.5% menthol ethanol solution as placebo. Solutions were applied to the forehead and temporal area of one or both sides of the head. Subjects in Arm B were managed in the opposite order receiving the placebo for the first two attacks and menthol for the second two attacks of migraine. If pain was not relieved after 2h of first application of intervention or placebo, patient was allowed to use any rescue medication for pain relief and associated symptoms. Patients and all investigators including a qualified neurologist, interviewers, research assistants and a statistician were completely blinded to the drug and placebo. Only the pharmacist preparing study medication who had no contact with study participants was not blinded. The codes were not broken till the study results were entirely analysed. Pain intensity was measured using the VAS, and a headache diary including information about the quality of the headache at minutes 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and hours 6, 12, 24 after application of drug or placebo. Results of hours 6 and 12 were not considered for data processing if a rescue drug had been used. Outcome was identified as pain relief, sustained pain freedom, alleviation of pain intensity and affiliated symptoms. In the intend-to-treat population, time by itself had been a determining factor on pain intensity drop (p = 0.000), however this drop is significantly different between the placebo and menthol groups during the first 2h (p = 0.010). 23⁄60 or 38.3% of attacks treated with menthol and 7 ⁄ 58 or 12.1% of attacks treated with the placebo had VAS = 0, 2h after application (p = 0.001). 35⁄60 or 58.3% of attacks treated with menthol and 10 ⁄ 58 or 17.2% of attacks treated with the placebo had more than 50% decrement in the VAS score in comparison to the baseline 2 h after the cutaneous application (p = 0.000). A total of 20 ⁄ 60 or 33.3% of drug treated attacks and 7⁄58 or 12.1% of placebo treated attacks had sustained pain free (VAS = 0) response during the first 24 h (p = 0.008).

In a randomised controlled crossover study conducted in University of Tsukuba, Japan, n=11 (mean age 20 ± 1 years) healthy male volunteers from the university field team specialising in long distance running events first underwent testing with a placebo solution (no race protocol), then underwent muscle soreness induction (race protocol). On day 1, they ran a 1500-m race, and on day 2, they ran a 3000-m race of the track and field event. On day 3, participants underwent testing with either menthol or placebo (randomised order) applied to their lower legs and performed another treadmill run to then report their pain. This protocol was repeated (cross-over design) after 23 ± 2 days. Solution of 4% L-menthol and 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) in 94.5% propylene glycol was used as the intervention condition, and 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in 98.5% propylene glycol was used as the placebo; both were applied to the entire lower extremity, including lower part of gluteus, except feet. Pain was measured using the modified version of the scale created by Green et al. (Green et al. 1993), ranging from 0 to 95 (0: no pain, between 5 and 10: weak, between 15 and 20: moderate, 35: strong, 50: very strong, 95: most severe imaginable; the participants selected values from the scale in increments of 5 from 0 to 95). The integrated muscle soreness index was assessed by averaging eight muscle soreness scores (i.e., gluteus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf during squatting and forward bending). Data was collected before and after application of solutions, and after treadmill run. Outcome was identified as changes to muscle soreness. Integrated muscle soreness (IMS) index pre-application of solution was higher in post-race placebo (PRP) than post-race menthol (PRM) (p = 0.034: +/- significant). Post application of solution IMS index was lower in PRM than in PRP (p = 0.001: significant). The index was not significantly different for PRP and PRM (p = 0.971) post-treadmill. Both post-race placebo and menthol groups had a higher pain score compared to no-race group, in pre application and post treadmill conditions (p < 0.001).

In a randomised, controlled, double-blinded crossover study, 54 (28 women, 13 men) patients (mean age 34.20 + 13.07) who experienced at least 1 tension type headache episode per month and were willing to maintain a headache diary were recruited. Patients consuming concomitant analgesics or drugs were excluded. Results were collected based on n=41 patients who had at least 4 headache episodes during the period of study and returned their diaries, and the total number of headache attacks studied was 164. Each of the 4 headache attacks was randomly treated simultaneously with paracetamol or a placebo (oral), and cutaneous application of either peppermint oil (10 g in ethanol 90%) or placebo oil (traces of peppermint oil in 90% ethanol) over large areas of the forehead and temples 15 minutes and 30 minutes after, using a Dabomatik applicator. The primary outcome was pain intensity, measured using a standardised category rating process (0=no pain, 1=very mild pain, 2=mild pain, 3=moderate pain, 4=severe pain), 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after application. Difference in frequency of pain between test groups was examined for significance using the chi-squared test of the Student’s t-test.

In a randomised controlled, trip-blinded study, n=10 volunteers (mean age 45(7)) were randomly assigned to 2 groups in a crossover design where menthol and placebo treatment order was randomised. The project was funded by The Hygenic Corporation , which provided the Biofreeze used in the trial. 4% active menthol gel with a variety of other ingredients (Biofreeze), and a placebo gel with menthol scent was applied with light strokes at the end of lunch break during a typical working day at the slaughterhouse, allowing for a 3-hour testing period after lunch, over 2 days (if menthol was applied on day 1, placebo was applied on day 2, and vice versa). A modified 0-10 VAS was used to collect data on pain intensity during the last hour of testing, where 0 indicates “no pain at all” and 10 indicates “worst pain imaginable”. Data on change in pain from before to after (average of 1, 2, and 3 hours after) application of the gel and global rating of change (GROC) on a scale from −5 (much worsening of pain) to 5 (much improvement of pain) 3 hours after application of the gel was also collected. The outcome was pain relief from chronic pain caused by CTS. A priori hypothesis testing showed a statistically significant group x time interaction for pain intensity (P = 0.026) from before to after (average of 1, 2, and 3 hours after) topical application. Compared with placebo, hand/wrist pain intensity decreased −1.2 (95% CI: −1.7 to −0.6) following Biofreeze application. The effect size (Cohen’s d) of the change in arm/hand pain was 0.63 and categorized as moderate with topical menthol.

This randomised controlled crossover study was conducted in the US and supported by a grant from Performance Health. 20 (mean age 54.94 (7.77) years) volunteers (14 female, 6 male) were included with a diagnosis of knee OA made by a physician and underwent menthol and placebo treatment in a randomised order on two separate days (7 day gap in between). Subjects were instructed to consume their prescribed dose of pain medication at the same prescribed time on both data collection days. All volunteers were asked to perform 5 functional tasks: 6-Minute Walk (6-MW), Timed Get Up and Go (TUG), a number of sit to stand repetitions in 30 seconds (timed chair stands, TCS), duration of time required to ascend 13 stairs (Up stairs) and descend 13 stairs (Down stairs), and pain rating were collected for the affected knee (unilateral), or the more painful knee (bilateral). Pre task and treatment testing was done using the WOMAC index which includes a measure for pain specific to knee OA. After each task, and after application of intervention, 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity. In random order, subjects received treatment of 3.5% menthol gel Biofreeze one day, and KY jelly, containing no neuroactive agents, primarily water, glycerine, and gluconolactone, on the other, both applied within 5 minutes of initial assessment of tasks to the anterior and posterior knee from the superior patella to the quadriceps insertion. Outcome was measured as pain relief in the affected knee. T-test comparisons indicated that the subjects did not report statistically different scores on their WOMAC index prior to either of their two data collection sessions in the laboratory. The analysis indicated no significant between-group differences or Time x Treatment interaction in pain while performing any of the functional tasks at any of the data collection time points. Significant time effect on the pain reported during the TUG (F = 4.90,P = 0.03), TCS(F = 7.41,P = 0.01), Upstairs (F = 16.60, P = 0 .00), and the Down stairs (F = 4.99, P = 0.03) functional tasks.

Mechanical pain was induced in the range of 0 to 300 pounds (136.1 kg) applied using a handheld algometer to the upper and lower body muscles. The tested upper body limb muscles consisted of the middle deltoid and biceps brachii. The lower body muscle groups consisted of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. To compare sensitivity differences between muscles and tendons, the patellar tendon, and Achilles tendon were also tested. In addition, as tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis/ epicondylosis) is a common injury, the lateral epicondylar tendon was also evaluated. The lower back was tested using the lumbosacral erector spinae muscles. The middle of the muscle belly for the biceps brachii, middle deltoid, hamstrings (biceps femoris), quadriceps (rectus femoris), and gastrocnemius was used. The measurement sites for the patella tendon and lateral epicondylar tendon were 1 cm distal from the bony origin. For the Achilles tendon, the measurement was taken at one third of the distance of the tendon length distal to its insertion. The intervention was application of 4% menthol-based Biofreeze to the mentioned muscles. PPT was measured pre and post application with a handheld algometer, and participants were instructed to provide a verbal report as soon as the quality of sensation changed from pressure to pain.

97950347,Fallon,2015,Cancer treatment-related neuropathic pain: proof of concept study with menthol--a TRPM8 agonist,"Fallon et al examined the effect of menthol treatment in patients experiencing neuropathic pain post cancer treatment at the Edinburgh Regional Cancer Centre. In this non-randomised non-controlled trial, n=51 patients (41/51 treated for cancer) experiencing chronic neuropathic pain (CIPN, scar pain,and other) that were refractive to conventional antineuropathic agents, for at least 6 months duration with average pain severity >=4 on a 0-10 scale were instructed to apply 1% levomenthol in the form of aqueous cream twice daily to affected area and corresponding dermatomal region of spine for 4-6 weeks. Complete data for n=38 patients was available at the end of this period. Data regarding pain and pain relief was collected using the following scales and tests: (1) short-form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); (2) Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS); (3) Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) mapping; (4) Mechanical Pain Threshold (MPT) (5) Mechanical pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia); (6) Temporal summation by NRS rating; (7) wind up ratio. All data was measured at baseline prior to treatment, after 2 weeks, and after 4-6 weeks of intervention. Outcome was identified as changes in pain score, pain threshold and pain areas. 82% (31/38) of evaluable patients had an improvement in their pain scores and 50% had a clinically relevant reduction in pain scores of at least 30 %. The median total BPI improved significantly from 47 to 34, P < 0.001.  There were also significant improvements in ‘worst pain item' (decrease, p = 0.001) and the pain interference subscales (decrease, p = 0.002). The mean total BPI decrease was 11 (standard deviation = 16). 11 % (4/38) experienced complete pain relief. All the statistically significant improvements in pain were also clinically significant. The LANSS scores did not demonstrate any significant treatment effect. In QST mapping, for the CIPN patients, the percentage of the distal limb skin which had abnormal sensation in response to brush, cool and warm stimuli decreased and moved distally (P<0.01).

98397044,Gobel,1994,Effect of Peppermint and Eucalyptus Oil Preparations on Neurophysiological and Experimental Algesimetric Headache Parameters,"Gobel et al studied the effects of peppermint and eucalyptus oil on neurophysiological and experimental algesimetric headache parameters among a sample population in Germany. In a randomised controlled, double-blinded crossover study, n=32 (mean 25 ± 2.1 years) healthy male volunteers were recruited and underwent topical application of 10g of peppermint oil combined with 100g of ethanol (90%) with traces of eucalyptus oil (PE), 10g peppermint oil, 5 g eucalyptus oil, 100g ethanol (PEuE), traces of peppermint oil, 5g eucalyptus oil, 100g ethanol (EuE), or traces of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil, 100g ethanol (E) on large areas of the skin of the forehead and temples. Solutions were applied on 4 different test days (separated by at least 1 day each) in random order and pain sensitivity of head structures was analysed by means of standardized recording of psychophysical stimulus-pain-functions for mechanical, thermal and ischaemic pain induction on each of the days. Pressure pain was induced using a mechanical pressure algesimeter whose  circular pressure pad had a bearing surface area of 2.56 mm2 and exerted a pressure of 2.6 Megapascal on the scalp. Thermal pain was induced with a 15 ohm ceramic resistance fixed to the forehead I cm above the root of the nose using an elastic band. Ischemia was induced using inflatable collar which was placed around the cranium and inflated to 200 mm Hg. Pain measures were taken for the scalp, forehead and pericranial musculature using a numeric scale from 0 to 50. This scale was also subdivided into the following verbal categories: 0 = no pain, 1-10 = very slight pain, 11-20 = slight pain, 21-30 = moderate pain, 31-40 = strong pain, and 41-50 = very strong pain. The test was discontinued if the pointer reached 50. Measures were collected at baseline and post-application. Outcome was measured as sensitivity to experimentally induced pain closely associated with headache mechanisms. There were non-significant differences pre- and post-application to pressure stimulus. There was significant decrease in heat stimulus perception when PE was applied PE (40.3% decrease, p < 0.001) and significant increase when E was applied (increase of 38.9% , p < 0.05), leading to significant differences between the effect of ethanol and that of the other preparations ( PE, PEuE, EuE) but not of PE with the two other preparations.

In this pre-post study conducted in Canada, aimed at examining the interactive effect of DOMS and a topical analgesic on corticospinal excitability and (PPT), 16 young, healthy, and recreationally active men were assigned to experience DOMS, and were randomly allocated intervention with menthol or a placebo gel (control): (n=16; menthol: n=8, placebo: n=8; all male). Eccentric elbow flexor contraction protocol was used to induce DOMS: five sets of 10 repetitions that were 5s each in duration. Each repetition was performed at a velocity ranging from 22°·s−1 to 24°·s−1 for all participants. Participants were given 90 s of rest between each set. 3.5% menthol gel (Biofreeze) or placebo gel was applied over the belly of the dominant biceps brachii. Pain pressure threshold was measured with an algometer before and after DOMS induction, and before and after gel application after DOMS.

97950457,Wasner,2008,The effect of menthol on cold allodynia in patients with neuropathic pain,"Wasner et al studied the effect of menthol on cold allodynia in patients experiencing neuropathic pain. They conducted a non-randomised controlled trial with a sample size of n=17; 8 participants were experiencing neuropathic pain (4 unilateral, 4 bilateral, mean age 60.5 ± 4.3), and 9 healthy volunteers were recruited as a control group (mean age 55.7 ± 3.2). Neuropathy was located to bilateral feet (3), bilateral hand, left lower leg, left cervical, left hand, and left foot of the 8 neuropathic patients; several patients were taking medication for pain relief of neuropathic symptoms (ongoing pain – 6/8, dynamical mechanical allodynia – 5/8, punctuate hyperalgesia – 1/8). A solution of L-menthol (40%, 400g) dissolved in 90% ethanol was applied to the affected painful areas in neuropathic patients; in patients with unilateral neuropathy menthol was applied to neuropathic skin and also contralaterally to unaffected mirror-image skin as a control. In patients with polyneuropathy with bilateral cold-induced pain at the distal extremities the effects of menthol were tested unilaterally in the limb in which cold-induced pain was described as more severe, and the data from equivalent skin areas in the control group was collected for comparative study. Data related to pain thresholds for cold induced pain, measured using a thermos-test device in °C was collected prior to and post application of menthol. Outcome was identified as modification of cold pain threshold. Prior to application of menthol, temperatures at which cold was perceived as painful were significantly higher in neuropathic skin relative to control indicating cold allodynia: 23.6 (7.7–25.9) and 11.4 (4.8–17.7) respectively (p = 0.006). These results were not different between patients with unilateral and bilateral neuropathic pain. After application of menthol, temperatures at which cold was perceived as painful were not different in neuropathic skin relative to control: 14.6 (2.6–24.7) and 16.1 (5.4–24.5) respectively (p = 0.288). After menthol, the cold pain threshold in the control areas was significantly decreased (pre vs post menthol p = 0.014) indicating induced cold allodynia. In contrast, within the area of pre-existing cold allodynia, menthol-induced changes on cold pain threshold showed a trend toward an increased threshold, i.e., reduced cold allodynia after menthol (pre vs post menthol p = 0.104). In patients with mechanically evoked pains (tested for punctuate hyperalgesia), menthol had no effect on mechanical dynamic allodynia, but reduced punctuate hyperalgesia in the one patient who suffered from this symptom. On the contralateral control side in this patient, menthol induced punctuate hyperalgesia as described in normal subjects.",Unregistered,Pre-post,Non-random,Pre-existing,Neuropathic cold allodynia,Neuropathic pain with cold allodynia,EUR,Germany,8,Mixed,Menthol,"Kieler Hofapotheke, Kiel, Germany - mentioned but unclear role",Solution,40,Location of cold allodynia,Inactive,No treatment,Pre-test baseline,NI,Threshold,Button press,75,% of patients that experienced increased cold pain threshold (6/8 patients),Positive,Non-significant,No information,N/A,none

Of interest in this study was the modification of heat and cold pain thresholds, as well as severity of itch. The study was a non-randomised study, and n=18 (9 male, 9 female) volunteers (mean age 47 ± 5 years) with no pre-existing pain conditions underwent testing for thermal pain thresholds using a thermal sensory probe, and n=16 underwent histamine-induced itching on the flexor aspect of the upper forearm, before and after application of menthol, in the form of L-Menthol (99.9%) 10% in 80% ethanol and 10% deionized H2O. This was compared to a control, where 80% ethanol and 20% deionized H2O was applied to the forearm. Control and menthol was applied one at a time, and the outcome was recorded as modification of the pain threshold recorded in degrees Celsius.

He had received 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine; relapsing after 21 months, he had completed first line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, at the time of case study needed second-line chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), bevacizumab, and oxaliplatin. He showed good clinical conditions, no comorbidities, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0; the only disabling symptom reported was the CIPN G2 (NCI CTCAE version 4.0), particularly to the extremities, previously treated with pregabalin without benefit. Treatment cycle with aqueous cream (galenic preparation) of 1% menthol for CIPN was identified, and menthol solution was applied to extremities twice a day during period of treatment: 5 cycles of chemotherapy, each cycle of 28 days. Pain was measured at baseline and at every cycle of chemotherapy on a 0–10 numeric pain rating scale (NRS), the neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI) and the Italian version of the Brief Pain Inventory (i-BPI). Outcome was pain relief and reduction in symptoms of neuropathy. During the first 4 months of chemotherapy, the NRS score for the neuropathy was 6 at cycle one, 5 at cycle two, 4 at cycles three and four, and 3 at cycle five. According to NPSI, while the duration of the pain remained the same through the 24 hours of the day, the scores that defined the tingling were 8 at cycle one, 7 at cycle two, 4 at cycle three, 8 at cycle four, and 5 at cycle five. i-BPI indicated no significant scores in answers 3, 4, 5, and 7, which defined the severity and intensity of the pain (every answer was less than or equal at 3 out of 10), while relevant scores were noted in answer 9, that describes how much the pain interferes with several everyday-life activities and with mood.

97950508,Davies,2002,A novel treatment of postherpetic neuralgia using peppermint oil,"Davies et al examined the effect of peppermint oil on postherapic neuralgia in a case study referred for treatment at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, UK. A 76-year-old woman was treated for herpes zoster infection, affecting her right breast and the inner aspect of her upper arm (T2 dermatome), with marked allodynia, marked dynamic mechanical allodynia and static mechanical hyperalgesia and hyperpathia in the affected areas. The patient had tried numerous drug treatments over the previous 3 years but experienced little benefit. She had been prescribed the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and dosulepin and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and gabapentin, but these yielded no relief. She had also reported that systemic sodium channel blockade, in the form of intravenous lidocaine, was unhelpful. Topical local anaesthetics in the form of EMLA cream (Astra Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, PA, U.S.A.) had also been used, but she found that the plastic film used to hold the cream in place exacerbated the allodynia. Capsaicin cream exacerbated her burning pain, so she had stopped using it. A thoracic epidural (with steroids) and acupuncture gave no relief. Further therapeutic options under consideration included an intercostal nerve block and a cognitive behavioural approach to her pain management. She was advised to massage 2-3 drops of peppermint oil with 10% menthol 3-4 times a day into the affected area. Pain level was measured before treatment with menthol, 2 weeks after treatment began, and 4 weeks after treatment began, using the VAS and short-form McGill pain questionnaire. Outcome was identified as pain relief. She described pain before treatment with menthol as a constant burning, with intermittent shooting pains that were rated as severe on a short-form McGill pain questionnaire, giving a total score of 12. She rated her pain in previous weeks on a visual analogue scale (0–100 points) with a score of 73. Her pain was exacerbated by heat, and she gained some relief from cold. She exhibited marked allodynia, especially from clothes, and would avoid wearing underwear and heavy clothing. 1-month pre-treatment, she showed marked dynamic mechanical allodynia (to a soft brush stroke) and static mechanical hyperalgesia and hyperpathia. Detection and pain thresholds to hot and cold stimuli, as measured by means of Peltier principle thermodes), were normal. After the first application of menthol, she experienced dramatic pain relief. At the 2-week follow-up, the patient stated that she was continuing to gain considerable relief from the postherpetic neuralgia, 2 minutes after each application for 6 hours. She experienced reduction in both the intensity of burning pain and the frequency and intensity of shooting pains. When asked again to rate on a visual analog scale the pain she had felt in the previous week, she gave a score of 19 (compared to baseline 73). The short-form McGill pain questionnaire was completed again and yielded a score of 5 (compared to baseline 12). Quantitative sensory testing was repeated and showed a reduction in hyperpathia, with no change in the intensity of dynamic mechanical allodynia or static mechanical hyperalgesia. Thermal detection and pain thresholds remained unchanged. When the effect of the oil had worn off, the returning pain was of the same intensity as that before she started the treatment. Minor adverse effects were reported; at two weeks, she experienced topical stinging sensation, lasting approximately 2 minutes on application. At 8 weeks follow-up, a local side effect was identified, where the treated skin had started reddening after 4 weeks of use, so instead the patient started to use a 1:5 dilution with almond oil (to give a menthol concentration of approximately 2%).
